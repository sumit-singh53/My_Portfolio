# This is a placeholder for favicon.ico
# To create a proper favicon:
# 1. Use your pixel-avatar.png image
# 2. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
# 3. Upload your pixel-avatar.png
# 4. Download the generated favicon.ico
# 5. Replace this file with the downloaded favicon.ico

# For now, we'll use the pixel-avatar.png as the icon in the HTML head
